# BiHeap
A biheap is a new independently developed data structure, a part of whose data is in a min heap, a part that is in a max heap, and a part that is in both simultaneously. The minimum and maximum elements in a BiHeap are readily accessible. This project implements the BiHeapify() function which given a random access iterator and a length, forms a biheap.
